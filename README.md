# Shortest Path Finder
Mini Project on visualizing pathfinding algorithms + maze solver using Pathfinding Algorithms like A*: Informed and Dijkstra's: Un-Informed.

This project simulates real-world navigation algorithms like Dijkstra's and A*â€”the same kind used in Google Maps to find the quickest and shortest route between source and destination.

# Algorithms used:
1. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm: for smooth line Drawing

2. Recursive Backtracking Algorithm: for maze creation

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Un-Informed

4. A* Algorithm: Informed

# Setup and How to run:

Please install the Dev C++ compiler, SFML, and add the required dll files in the same directory where your project file is for this program to compile.

Add the following required linkers:

-static-libgcc -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -mwindows

And also change the Language standard (-std) to ISO C++ 11 in code generation of the settings inside the compiler option.
